# IMUF Official Releases
Hex releases for supported firmware.

The hexes are aggregates of the firmware plus any updates to our IMUF code. They are concatenated into an aggregate using the provided concat.py script. See https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/blob/master/LICENSE lines 235-243.


```
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.
